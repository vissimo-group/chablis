</p>

<br>

<i align="center">It is still in early development</i>

## Examples

We have all components listed on our documentation. Here is the first one to get you started:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Button } from "chablis";

class HelloButton extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Button>Hello World</Button>;
  }
}

export default HelloButton;
```

## Installation

```bash
yarn add chablis
```

But all commands run with `npm` as well.

## Debug

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the storybook at development mode and exposes it on `localhost:9001`

## Testing

All of the chablis tests are written with jest and enzyme. Just run

```bash
yarn test
```
